A simple desktop app for managing raffles with a so called "pity" mechanic (extra tickets for past losses), featuring Twitch integration for running a bot and letting chatters sign themselves up.
Uses AvaloniaUI over .NET C#.
My first time using writing a Twitch bot and using Avalonia so might not be top notch software, but it definitely works!
